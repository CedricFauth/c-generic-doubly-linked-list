# Universal Doubly Linked List

## Conventions
- write smart and clean code - but readable
- refactor your code
- comments before/in every function
- no recursion
- no global variables
- CHECK FOR NULL and print error messages
- meaningful names for functions, variables etc.
- index variables may be short (i,j,k etc.)
- use snake_case NOT camelCase, kebab-case etc.
